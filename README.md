# Analyzing the Impact of Social Media Usage on Productivity

## Project Description
This project aims to explore the relationship between my social media usage(specifically YouTube and TikTok)and my productivity levels as measured by focused study time recorded in the Forest app. By analyzing personal data collected over a two-month period, I hope to gain insights into how social media consumption affects my ability to focus and be productive.


## Motivation
Understanding how time spent on social media impacts productivity can help develop better time management strategies and improve focus, especially in an academic setting.


## Data Sources
1. **YouTube Watch History**
-**Data Collected:** Video titles, channel names, and timestamps of when videos were watched.
-**Enhancements Planned:** Use the YouTube Data API to obtain additional details such as video durations and categories.

2. **TikTok Screen Time Data**
-**Data Collected:** Daily total screen time manually recorded from the TikTok app.

3. **Forest App Productivity Data**
-**Data Collected:** Focused study time and number of focus sessions per day.


## Project Plan

1. **Data Collection and Enhancement**

Collect daily data from all three sources until the project deadline.
Enhance YouTube data by extracting video durations and categories using the YouTube Data API.

2. **Data Preprocessing**

Clean and organize data into a consistent format.
Align data from different sources based on dates.
Handle missing or incomplete data appropriately.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**

Compute descriptive statistics for social media usage and productivity metrics.
Visualize data to identify trends and patterns over time.
Analyze correlations between variables to explore relationships.

4. **Machine Learning Modeling**

Regression Analysis: Build models to predict productivity levels based on social media usage.
Classification: Categorize days into 'High Productivity' and 'Low Productivity' based on focus time, using classification algorithms.

5. **Interpretation of Results**

Interpret statistical findings and model outcomes.
Discuss whether the data supports the hypothesis that increased social media usage negatively impacts productivity.

6. **Documentation and Reporting**

Document all steps, methodologies, and code used in the analysis.
Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the project.
Reflect on limitations and propose areas for future research.
